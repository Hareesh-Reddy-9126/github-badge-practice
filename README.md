## How to Earn the Galaxy Brain Badge

The Galaxy Brain achievement is unlocked when your answer in a GitHub Discussion is marked as the accepted answer. You need **at least 1 accepted answer** to earn the first tier.

### Badge Tiers

| Tier | Accepted Answers Required |
|------|--------------------------|
| 🥉 Galaxy Brain x1 | 1 accepted answer |
| 🥈 Galaxy Brain x2 | 8 accepted answers |
| 🥇 Galaxy Brain x3 | 16 accepted answers |

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Go to the [GitHub Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions)
2. Browse **unanswered questions** in these categories (click the links to go directly):
   - [General](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/general)
   - [Programming Help](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/programming-help)
   - [Actions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/actions)
   - [Copilot](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot)
   - [Code Security](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/code-security)
   - [Pages](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/pages)
   - [Pull Requests](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/pull-requests)
   - [Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/repositories)
3. Look for questions that have **no accepted answer** yet and that match your knowledge
4. Post a **clear, detailed, and helpful answer**
5. If the question author marks your answer as the accepted answer ✅, you earn progress

### Practice with a Friend

Yes! You **can** earn the Galaxy Brain badge by practicing with a friend. The badge works on **any** GitHub repository that has Discussions enabled — not just the GitHub Community forum. Here's how:

1. **Enable Discussions** on this repository (Settings → General → Features → ✅ Discussions)
2. Ask your friend to **create a new Discussion** (Q&A category) in this repo
3. **Post your answer** to your friend's question
4. Your friend **marks your answer as accepted** ✅
5. You earn progress toward the Galaxy Brain badge! 🎉

Repeat this process to reach higher tiers:
- Do it **1 time** → 🥉 Galaxy Brain x1
- Do it **8 times** → 🥈 Galaxy Brain x2
- Do it **16 times** → 🥇 Galaxy Brain x3

> **Note:** Each accepted answer must be on a **different discussion**. The same discussion can only count once. Your friend needs their own GitHub account to create discussions and mark answers.

### Tips to Get Your Answer Accepted

- **Answer quickly** — Be one of the first to respond to a new question
- **Be detailed** — Include step-by-step instructions, code snippets, or screenshots
- **Link to official docs** — Reference GitHub's official documentation to back up your answer
- **Be friendly and helpful** — A polite tone increases the chance the author accepts your answer
- **Focus on unanswered questions** — Questions that already have many answers are less likely to accept yours
- **Pick topics you know well** — GitHub Actions, Pages, Repos, and Pull Requests are common areas where people need help
