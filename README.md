### Tips to Get Your Answer Accepted

- **Answer quickly** — Be one of the first to respond to a new question
- **Be detailed** — Include step-by-step instructions, code snippets, or screenshots
- **Link to official docs** — Reference GitHub's official documentation to back up your answer
- **Be friendly and helpful** — A polite tone increases the chance the author accepts your answer
- **Focus on unanswered questions** — Questions that already have many answers are less likely to accept yours
- **Pick topics you know well** — GitHub Actions, Pages, Repos, and Pull Requests are common areas where people need help
